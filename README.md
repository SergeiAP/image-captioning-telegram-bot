See videos [here in Google.Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M5g6UVQ-JAQf4TxNbmukhwilOzbcOsyZ?usp=sharing).    
# Before deploying
It is required change two files in __data__ folder: __handler random__ in __config.py__ depending on where bot is going to be deployed and change __.env__ file. And change imports in __handlers->users->random_click.py__ corresponding to chosen __handler random__ (it was made so to not import extra libraries).   
Also it is required to download models from the folder in [Google.Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N44O-Rt6Gio8R-pdF-y5dCOQTKqVlH5n) to `./functional/data/`
